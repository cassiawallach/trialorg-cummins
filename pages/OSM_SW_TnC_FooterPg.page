                                    <br/><li><b>Orders</b>. You can place orders for Website Purchases through the Website (each, an “<b>Order</b>”).

                                    <br/><li><b>Term, Suspension and Termination</b>. With regard to any Website Purchase, these Terms shall be effective beginning on first day of the Initial Term for such Website Purchase and shall continue thereafter for the Initial Term of such Website Purchase, unless earlier terminated as described below. Following the Initial Term, these Terms shall automatically renew on a Billing Period-by-Billing Period basis thereafter (each a “<b>Renewal Term</b>”) under the same terms and conditions, unless either you or Cummins notifies the other in writing of its intention not to renew these Terms at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the final Renewal Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the end of the Initial Term, we may increase your recurring fees for Website Purchases upon prior written notice to you, but in the event of an increase you shall have the right to terminate the Website Purchases and these Terms immediately by providing us notice of termination within 10 days of receiving the increase notice. We may suspend or terminate these Terms, suspend or disable the Website Purchases or any portion of Website Purchases immediately without notice to you, and without liability, if (a) we cease to provide services associated with a Website Purchase generally or in your area, (b) you fail to remain eligible for Website Purchases as described in Section 3 above, (c) we are unable to communicate with you (including when your registered email account is or becomes invalid) or validate your account, (d) you fail to login after [X] days, (e) you fail to make any payments due under or otherwise violate the conditions of these Terms or any other agreement between you and us, (f) you use Website Purchases for an unlawful purpose, or (g) your use of Website Purchases (i) harms or interferes with our systems or network, (ii) violates privacy or intellectual property rights, or (iii) publishes or disseminates threatening, obscene or offensive material. Upon termination for any reason, you are responsible for the payment of all fees and charges. If we reinstate your Website Purchases in our sole discretion, we may require several days to complete the reinstatement and may charge you a reinstatement fee. Notwithstanding anything else contained in these Terms, we reserve the right to terminate these Terms and Website Purchases for any other reason, without cause and without any liability, upon 30 days advance written notice to you, provided that in such event we shall refund to you any unused Website Purchases fees on a pro-rated based.  Website Purchases may be subject to additional terms and conditions specific to such Website Purchase, including regarding termination and cancellation.  Such terms and conditions will, to the maximum extent possible, be interpreted to be consistent with and supplemental to these Terms but, if there is a conflict between the termination rights in this Section 5 and such terms and conditions, the conflict will be resolved by giving priority to the termination rights in the terms and conditions specific to such Website Purchase.</li>
                                    <br/><li><b>Fees and Payment</b>.

We are not responsible for pricing, typographical or other errors in offers for Website Purchases. Fees do not include taxes or other government required fees. We will charge you for such taxes and fees for Website Purchases with respect to states and other jurisdictions for which we are obligated to collect and report them. The tax rate / regulations in effect at the time the order is placed will be applicable for the entire subscription length. Any one-time orders placed in the middle of the subscription lifecycle will reflect the taxation rates / regulations at the time of order placement. To the extent you are tax exempt, a valid tax exemption certificate evidencing as such must be provided at least five (5) business days in advance of the Website Purchase. We must approve the tax-exempt status prior to any Website Purchase in order for you to be qualified as tax exempt. Any Website Purchases made in advance of any such approval by us shall be taxed and no tax refunds shall be issued. Any tax exemption certificate approved by us will only apply to orders placed after such approval.
                                    <br/>   <br/>Unless otherwise stated on the Website or in the relevant Invoice, (i) with respect to any payments for Website Purchases being made by credit card, we will invoice you for Website Purchases in advance of each Billing Period, and you must pay us by the date set forth in the Invoice and (ii) with respect to all other forms of payment for Website Purchases, we will invoice you for Website Purchases within thirty (30) days of the first day of each Billing Period, and you must pay us by the date set forth in the Invoice, which such payment date shall be in accordance with your customer payment terms in our current billing and payment system, as applicable. Any undisputed amount payable by you hereunder which remains unpaid after the due date shall be subject to a late charge equal to the lesser of one percent (1%) per month of such unpaid amount or the maximum interest allowed by law from the due date until we receives full payment. Our billing and payment process may be managed by a third party service provider directly on our behalf. We or such provider may collect billing and payment information, such as credit card numbers and other information about you (e.g., address and postal code) that is necessary to ensure that the transaction is properly authorized. Our service provider may retain such information to facilitate future transactions.</li>

                                        <li><b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</b>.</li>
                                        <li>Subject to Section 18, any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims or causes of action between you and Cummins or its employees, agents, successors, or assigns that arise from or relate to the Website or Website Purchases (including those related to the interpretation and scope of this agreement to arbitrate, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, counts, claim or cause of action), shall exclusively be settled via binding and arbitration; except that you or Cummins may take claims to small claims court in the United States if the dispute qualifies for hearing in such court or take to the court any challenge to the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver. Provided, however, that if a claim that you or Cummins brings in small claims court is transferred to any court other than a small claims court, the dispute shall immediately become subject to arbitration in accordance with this agreement. Each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</li>
                                        <li>This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted, and expressly includes claims brought under any law, statute, regulation, or legal or equitable theory. You and Cummins agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1, et seq. (“<b>FAA</b>”), applies to this agreement to arbitrate, and governs all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</li>
                                        <li>Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of filing of the arbitration, or if appropriate, by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“<b>ICDR</b>”) under its International Dispute Resolution Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the arbitration (collectively, the “<b>Rules</b>”). If the AAA or ICDR is unavailable, you and Cummins shall agree to another arbitration body or one shall be selected by a court of justice.</li>
                                        <li>Subject to the terms and limitations in these Terms, including those set forth in Section 12, the arbitrator(s) may award any damages and relief (including attorneys’ fees) authorized by law or the Rules. The award is final and binding and judgment on it may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with the FAA.</li>
                                        <li>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in courts of justice. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU AND CUMMINS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. (the “<b>Class Action Waiver</b>”). THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR CLASS ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE PROCEDURES OR RULES OF THE AAA OR ICDR WOULD. RATHER, YOU AND CUMMINS ARE ONLY ENTITLED TO PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL, BILATERAL BASIS. FURTHER, AND UNLESS YOU AND CUMMINS AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIMS WITH ANY OTHER PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE, COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING.</li>
                                        <li>Subject to your and our compliance with Section 18, payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Rules; provided, however, that we will pay such fees to the extent necessary for this agreement to arbitrate to be enforceable. Arbitration under this agreement to arbitrate shall be held in the city, town or village where you live or work; Indianapolis, Indiana; or any other location we mutually agree to. The arbitration shall be conducted and the award shall be rendered in the English language.</li>
                                        <li>This agreement to arbitrate does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of international, federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.</li>
                                        <li>You may decline this agreement to arbitrate (i.e., “<b>opt-out</b>”) by emailing Cummins at legal.function@cummins.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) your phone number, (4) the URL containing these Terms, and (5) clear statement that you wish to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. This opt-out notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept these Terms.</li>
                                        <li>If any term(s) of this agreement to arbitrate are illegal or unenforceable, the terms(s) shall be severed, and the remainder of this agreement shall be given full force and effect. Also, if the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular remedy, then that claim or that remedy (and only that claim or that remedy) shall be severed and brought in a court of justice, and all other claims and remedies shall be arbitrated in accordance with this agreement to arbitrate.</li>

                                    <br/><li><b>Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes</b>. Before either you or we commence arbitration in accordance with Section 17, a party must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to us should be sent by email to: <a style="font-size:14px" href= "mailto:legal.function@cummins.com" target="_blank" >legal.function@cummins.com</a>. The Notice to you will be sent to any email address we have for you in our files. The Notice must (a) include your name; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you are entitled. If you have complied with the requirements of this Section and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that exceeds the value of our last written settlement to you before the appointment of the arbitrator, then we will pay you $1,000 in lieu of any smaller award. In determining whether you are entitled to the minimum $1,000 recovery, the arbitrator shall not consider amounts offered or awarded for attorneys’ fees or costs. Any disputes as to recovery of the $1,000 minimum recovery shall be resolved by the arbitrator, and must be raised within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
                                    <br/><li><b>Relationship of the Parties</b>. The relationship between the parties to these Terms is and shall be that of independent contractors. The parties expressly acknowledge that nothing in these Terms shall be construed to create or imply a partnership, joint venture, agency relationship or contract of employment. Neither party shall have the authority to make any statement, representation nor commitment of any kind, or to take any action that shall be binding on the other party except as authorized in writing by the party to be bound.</li>
                                    <br/><li><b>Miscellaneous</b>. These Terms, any terms associated with the product or service itself, the Privacy Policy and the Invoice constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to your use of Website Purchases (including the Website).  All prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, understandings and communications between you and us regarding the subject matter hereof, whether oral or written, are superseded by and merged into these Terms. Except as expressly permitted by these Terms, these Terms may be amended only by mutual written agreement of authorized representatives of both you and Cummins. If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason under relevant law, then that part will be deemed replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remaining Terms will continue in full force and effect. Cummins’ failure to enforce strict performance of any part of these Terms does not waive any of our rights. We may assign our rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without your consent. Expiration or termination of the Term will not affect accrued rights, indemnities, existing commitments or any contractual provision intended to survive termination</li>
