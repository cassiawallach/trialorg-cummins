    <subject>Your Case {!Case.CaseNumber} Is Pending Approval For Service Plus Pro.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

Service plus is for HHP (high horsepower) engines.

It has come to our attention that these types of subscriptions have been given in error throughout the years. Service plus is reserved for distributors and for approved fleets/dealers. 

We are in the process of correcting this known issue. This is a managed program that requires further approval.

Please make sure to fill out questions below entirely and in detail, including Engine types and sizes. This will help determine what is needed for your units.

If you are Tax Exempt, please send an updated Tax Exemption Form to include your Cummins Account # to - CSSNATaxExempt@cummins.com so the Tax records can be updated for your account.

Thank you.
