    <textOnly>Hi,

Thank you for your query in regards to purchasing an Insite subscription, please follow Insite set up checklist below:

1. Purchase Inline 7 Adapter Kit. See part number and pricing below. We recommend you obtain the Inline Adapter and download the Insite software before purchasing a subscription. The subscription starts from the day it is created - make sure the hardware and software is operating correctly so you don&apos;t lose any subscription time.

2. Install Insite 8.7.x and Inline 7 driver software from https://www.cummins.com/parts-and-service/digital-products-and-services/insite .Make sure you have checked Cummins Update Manager to confirm you are on the latest software version. You can open it directly by searching &quot;Update Manager&quot; in the start menu. LAN connection to the internet is required for downloading and installing updates.

3. Fill in attached form for your Insite subscription. Type in all of the details and email it along with a copy of your purchase order to 1300cummins@cummins.com. Once the form is filled in and returned you will receive your activation passwords by email.

(See attached file: Insite Form.pdf)

4. We will process your order, create a new license and send back your activation keys. Processing time is 24-48 hours.

5. Activate your license. You can open the License Configuration tool directly without opening Insite by searching &quot;LCT&quot; in your Windows Start menu search function. Enter in both activation keys in &quot;Activate Licenses/Counts&quot; menu for full functionality of your subscription.
