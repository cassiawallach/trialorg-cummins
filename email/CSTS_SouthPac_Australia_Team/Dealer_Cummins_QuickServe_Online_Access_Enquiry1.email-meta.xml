    <textOnly>ummins QuickServe Online (QSOL) is the best source of Cummins engine parts and service information.

To subscribe for Dealer access to QSOL, please complete the attached subscription form and return it to the Cummins Support Centre at this email address.  We will create your individual users as detailed on your completed form, and charge you for the annual subscription fee of $insert current list price excluding GST here (excluding GST) .

The subscription is for 12 months from the day we create the subscription.  Although there are only 11 spaces for users on the form, there is no limit to how many users you may create under your fleet subscription - just fill in additional copies of the form as required.

Globally, each user name in QSOL must be unique.  Because of this, Cummins suggests using a format for user names of a first initial and surname, eg John Smith would be jsmith.  If by chance a requested user name is already in use we will just add a number on to the end, eg jsmith1.  This is only a suggested format and you are welcome to use almost anything you like if you have another preferred format.

(See attached file: QSOL New User Form.docx)

If you have any other questions about QSOL or the registration process, please just ask.
